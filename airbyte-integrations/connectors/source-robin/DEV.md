- The Robin documentation doesn't seem to be up-to-date; the page describing the User resource https://docs.robinpowered.com/reference/user does not list all the fields that appear on User resources that appear in the API such as with /organizations/:id/users
- Sample "event" object here: https://docs.robinpowered.com/reference/event has a string for the 'id' field, but it is integer everyhwere else.
